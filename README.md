### Heroku

- Bundle customized :  
  `Follow carefully the documentation`  
  <https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack>

- If the javascript bundle location is customized, such as with an ejected created-react-app project, then `the runtime may not be able to locate the bundle to inject runtime variables`.  
  To solve this so the runtime can locate the bundle, set the custom bundle path:  
  $ heroku config:set JS_RUNTIME_TARGET_BUNDLE = ./dist/\*.js  
  In environnement devlopment the static.json file is required to use this buildpack. This file handles all the configuration described.
